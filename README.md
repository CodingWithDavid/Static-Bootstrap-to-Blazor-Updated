# Bootstrap static web site to Blazor Application (Updated)

I was working with Azure Static websites and I decide I wanted to create a blog post about it.

## Why

Instead of doing a simple weather forecast application like all the others, I decided to update one of my original Blazor projects I blog about.  The original project was built back in November 2019.  A lot has changed since then.

This project is the result of that update.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/Static-Bootstrap-to-Blazor-Updated
   cd Static-Bootstrap-to-Blazor-Updated
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
b.  With Visual Code you will need to install the Blazor extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. Created by a new Azure Website web assembly project template directly in Github to my repository
2. Updated Blazored Modal
3. Updated Blazored Toast
3. Refactored the javascript work around for same page anchor tag navigation to a script block in the index.html instead of a separate js file.
4. Refactored the portfolio and contact me services into Azure functions
